# Portfolio

This is my portfolio website using react and typescript. Current URL: https://portfolio-react-iota-five.vercel.app/

## Project Intent

The intention of this project is to learn the basics of frontend development through real-world practice.

## Next Steps

I plan to redesign and improve the layout, as well as implement some new CSS and JavaScript features.

## Overview

- Hosted with Vercel
- Hero, About, Projects, and Contact sections.
- Spotify embed player.
- Scroll-to-top button which appears when the page is scrolled down.
- Fade-into-view of elements as they are scrolled into view.
- Elements zoom on mouse hover.
- Additional CSS transitions on mouse actions, CSS shadows, and gradients.

## To-Do List

- Add resume download/display functionality to the CV button in the menu.
- Add personal experiences with programming to the Projects section (e.g., ShuttleTrak, -2XC3 final lab, this website, and more if I remember any). Could learn to implement CSS grid for this.
- Add contact information (email, phone, etc.) at the top of the page.
- Add contact information to the Contact section.
- Implement scrolling effects (scaling, color, etc.)
- Customize domain name and add URL to resume.
